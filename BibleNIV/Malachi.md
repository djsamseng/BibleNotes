## Notes

- The Jews brought defiled food as offerings and called that a burden. Malachi condemns this.
- Malachi sarcastically questions the people on "It is futile to serve" (Malachi 3:14 NIV)
- Malachi is trying to get the people back on the right track. **But Malachi isn't setting the rules**. We can't use Malachi as strict rules on how to tithe. Instead we can use Malachi as motivation and hope in what God and Jesus have told us to do.

> You have wearied the Lord with your words (Malachi 2:17 NIV)

Evidence this isn't God speaking but instead Malachi?

> I the Lord do not change (Malachi 3:6 NIV)

This is not God saying God doesn't change. This is Malachi telling the people that God remains faithful to his covenant. God hasn't destroyed the covenant with his people like the people of the time thought God did
