## Notes

#### The Law and the spirit of the law
> Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. (Jesus speaking) (Matthew 5:17 NIV)

- Jesus is speaking against hypocritical legalism. He is speaking against those who kept the law externally while breaking them internally.

> Do not murder... But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgement... Therefore if you... remember that your borther has something against you... go and be reconciled to your brother (Jesus speaking) (Matthew 5:21 NIV)

#### Settle matters with your adversary
> Settle matters quickly with you adversary (Jesus speaking) (Matthew 5:25 NIV)

#### Divorce and adultery
> You shall not commit adultery (God speaking) (Exodus 20:14 NIV)

> anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery. (Jesus speaking) (Matthew 5:32)

> anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, and marries another woman commits adultery (Matthew 19:9 NIV)

- This was referencing Deuteronomy 24:1 where men were divorcing their wives because they were becoming displeasing to them. Jesus counters with

> Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate (Jesus speaking) (Matthew 19:6 NIV)

- so while it _seems_ that divorce may be allowed by the Old Testament (Deuteronomy 24:1) Jesus is focusing on the spirit of it rather than the letter of the Law. It's probably not good to be going around marrying and divorcing people all the time. In fact we should try to avoid divorce. But in the case of marital unfaithfulness Jesus gives us a choice.

#### Oaths

> Do not swear at all... Simply let your 'Yes' be 'Yes', and your 'No', 'No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one (Jesus speaking) (Matthew 5:33 NIV)

- Wise advice both as the receiver and the giver

#### Eye for an Eye

> Do not resist an evil person (Jesus speaking) (Matthew 5:39)

- _Resist_ = _insult_ instead of _an act of violence_
- The point being: __It's better to be insulted twice than to take the matter to court__

> “You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.’ But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also. And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well. If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you. (Jesus speaking) (Matthew 5:38)


#### Love your enemies

> But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven (Jesus speaking) (Matthew 5:44 NIV)

- Prayer is one of the practical ways to love. Prayer is an excellent way to deescalate situations with your enemies
- Be like Jesus by loving your enemies and praying for those who persecute you
