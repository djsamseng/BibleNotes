## Notes

#### The Law and the spirit of the law
> Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. (Jesus speaking) (Matthew 5:17 NIV)

- Jesus is speaking against hypocritical legalism. He is speaking against those who kept the law externally while breaking them internally.

> Do not murder... But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgement... Therefore if you... remember that your borther has something against you... go and be reconciled to your brother (Jesus speaking) (Matthew 5:21 NIV)

#### Settle matters with your adversary
> Settle matters quickly with you adversary (Jesus speaking) (Matthew 5:25 NIV)

#### Divorce and adultery
> You shall not commit adultery (God speaking) (Exodus 20:14 NIV)

> anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery. (Jesus speaking) (Matthew 5:32)

> anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, and marries another woman commits adultery (Matthew 19:9 NIV)

- This was referencing Deuteronomy 24:1 where men were divorcing their wives because they were becoming displeasing to them. Jesus counters with

> Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate (Jesus speaking) (Matthew 19:6 NIV)

- so while it _seems_ that divorce may be allowed by the Old Testament (Deuteronomy 24:1) Jesus is focusing on the spirit of it rather than the letter of the Law. It's probably not good to be going around marrying and divorcing people all the time. In fact we should try to avoid divorce. But in the case of marital unfaithfulness Jesus gives us a choice.

#### Oaths

> Do not swear at all... Simply let your 'Yes' be 'Yes', and your 'No', 'No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one (Jesus speaking) (Matthew 5:33 NIV)

- Wise advice both as the receiver and the giver

#### Eye for an Eye

> Do not resist an evil person (Jesus speaking) (Matthew 5:39)

- _Resist_ = _insult_ instead of _an act of violence_
- The point being: __It's better to be insulted twice than to take the matter to court__

> “You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.’ But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also. And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well. If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you. (Jesus speaking) (Matthew 5:38)


#### Love your enemies

> But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven (Jesus speaking) (Matthew 5:44 NIV)

- Prayer is one of the practical ways to love. Prayer is an excellent way to deescalate situations with your enemies
- Be like Jesus by loving your enemies and praying for those who persecute you

#### Matthew 6
- 1: When you give, not if. Jesus was concerned about the motives for giving
- 6: Long prayerrs aren't bad but meaningless verbiage isn't desired
- 19:21 Riches themselves are nowhere condemnded
- Jesus condemns greed and hoarding of wealth
- 22: Lamp, eyes are good meaning a healthy attitude towards wealth. Don't be stingy
- 25: Do not worry = don't be anxious. Worry is ok
- 27: Anxiety will shorten your life
- 33: Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness = the life God requires
  - Personal righteousness + justice for the oppressed (5:6)
  - may be seen as offensive to outsiders (5:10)
  - following the spirit of the law not just the letter of the law (5:18-20)
  - with humility and not for self glorification (6:1)

#### Matthew 7
- 1: Do not judge
  - don't be hypocriticaal or judge self-righteously to elevate yourself
  - **allows** for assesing other people's character
    - ex: whether someone is a dog (7:6), false prophet (7:15) vs someone who shows fruit in their life (7:16)
    - Repeatedly urges us to evaluate others as good or bad people
      - sexually immoral (1 Corintheans 5:9)
        - Paul saying to dissasociate with immoral people of the church **not** immoral people in general.
        - **Nothing to do with sex**
      - falsely pretending to be angels (2 Corintheans 11:14)
        - Paul saying to beward of those who preach and burden you
        > Preaching the gospel free of charge... I was not a burden to anyone
        - Jesus is a free gift
      - dogs (Philipeans 3:2)
        - Paul saying "men who do evil". Paul's opponents as "those who mutilants of the flesh"
      - false prophets (1 John 4:1)
      - "test everything" (1 Thesselonians 5:21)
        - Paul regarding those who claim to speak in the name of the Lord
- 7: Ask and it will be given to you
  - Persistent prayer is emphasized, constant seeking and knocking
  - references Luke 11:5-13 where the friend goes to a friend's house who has already locked up for the night. The friend asks for bread. The home owner gets up after telling his friend that he's closed because of the man's persistence not because he's a friend
  - wisdom: **Persistence is needed when we want to achieve a goal** or change
- 11: God gives gifts to those who ask
  - active learning, active achieving
- 12: Do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the prophets
