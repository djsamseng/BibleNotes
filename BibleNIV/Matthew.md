## Notes

#### The Law and the spirit of the law
> Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. (Jesus speaking) (Matthew 5:17 NIV)

- Jesus is speaking against hypocritical legalism. He is speaking against those who kept the law externally while breaking them internally.

> Do not murder... But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgement... Therefore if you... remember that your borther has something against you... go and be reconciled to your brother (Jesus speaking) (Matthew 5:21 NIV)

#### Settle matters with your adversary
> Settle matters quickly with you adversary (Jesus speaking) (Matthew 5:25 NIV)

#### Divorce and adultery
> You shall not commit adultery (God speaking) (Exodus 20:14 NIV)

> anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery. (Jesus speaking) (Matthew 5:32)

> anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, and marries another woman commits adultery (Matthew 19:9 NIV)

- This was referencing Deuteronomy 24:1 where men were divorcing their wives because they were becoming displeasing to them. Jesus counters with

> Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate (Jesus speaking) (Matthew 19:6 NIV)

- so while it _seems_ that divorce may be allowed by the Old Testament (Deuteronomy 24:1) Jesus is focusing on the spirit of it rather than the letter of the Law. It's probably not good to be going around marrying and divorcing people all the time. In fact we should try to avoid divorce. But in the case of marital unfaithfulness Jesus gives us a choice.

#### Oaths

> Do not swear at all... Simply let your 'Yes' be 'Yes', and your 'No', 'No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one (Jesus speaking) (Matthew 5:33 NIV)

- Wise advice both as the receiver and the giver

#### Eye for an Eye

> Do not resist an evil person (Jesus speaking) (Matthew 5:39)

- _Resist_ = _insult_ instead of _an act of violence_
- The point being: __It's better to be insulted twice than to take the matter to court__

> “You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.’ But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also. And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well. If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you. (Jesus speaking) (Matthew 5:38)


#### Love your enemies

> But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven (Jesus speaking) (Matthew 5:44 NIV)

- Prayer is one of the practical ways to love. Prayer is an excellent way to deescalate situations with your enemies
- Be like Jesus by loving your enemies and praying for those who persecute you

#### Matthew 6
- 1: When you give, not if. Jesus was concerned about the motives for giving
- 6: Long prayerrs aren't bad but meaningless verbiage isn't desired
- 19:21 Riches themselves are nowhere condemnded
- Jesus condemns greed and hoarding of wealth
- 22: Lamp, eyes are good meaning a healthy attitude towards wealth. Don't be stingy
- 25: Do not worry = don't be anxious. Worry is ok
- 27: Anxiety will shorten your life
- 33: Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness = the life God requires
  - Personal righteousness + justice for the oppressed (5:6)
  - may be seen as offensive to outsiders (5:10)
  - following the spirit of the law not just the letter of the law (5:18-20)
  - with humility and not for self glorification (6:1)

#### Matthew 7
- 1: Do not judge
  - don't be hypocriticaal or judge self-righteously to elevate yourself
  - **allows** for assesing other people's character
    - ex: whether someone is a dog (7:6), false prophet (7:15) vs someone who shows fruit in their life (7:16)
    - Repeatedly urges us to evaluate others as good or bad people
      - sexually immoral (1 Corintheans 5:9)
        - Paul saying to dissasociate with immoral people of the church **not** immoral people in general.
        - **Nothing to do with sex**
      - falsely pretending to be angels (2 Corintheans 11:14)
        - Paul saying to beward of those who preach and burden you
        > Preaching the gospel free of charge... I was not a burden to anyone
        - Jesus is a free gift
      - dogs (Philipeans 3:2)
        - Paul saying "men who do evil". Paul's opponents as "those who mutilants of the flesh"
      - false prophets (1 John 4:1)
      - "test everything" (1 Thesselonians 5:21)
        - Paul regarding those who claim to speak in the name of the Lord
- 7: Ask and it will be given to you
  - Persistent prayer is emphasized, constant seeking and knocking
  - references Luke 11:5-13 where the friend goes to a friend's house who has already locked up for the night. The friend asks for bread. The home owner gets up after telling his friend that he's closed because of the man's persistence not because he's a friend
  - wisdom: **Persistence is needed when we want to achieve a goal** or change
- 11: God gives gifts to those who ask
  - active learning, active achieving
- 12: Do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the prophets
- 13: Narrow gate - leads to life. Wide gate - leads to desctruction
  - Successful people take the path less traveled, try something new and discover new life
  - There's many temptations and alternatives to Jesus' way but they lead to destruction
  - Only through Jesus do we get to heaven and true joy
- 15: Watch out for false prophets - by their fruit you will recognize them
  - Do they produce joy, peace and love?
  - Are they on the path to destruction?
  - Do they remain attached to Jesus?
    - Jesus is the vine, we are the branches, and the fruit is what we produce (John 15:5)
- 21: Only he who does the will of God will enter the kingdom of heaven
  - This is the deciding factor on who enters the kingdom of heaven
  - Paul in Romans 10:9
    > If you confess with your mouth "Jesus is Lord" and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved
- 22: Many will claim to have done God's work but Jesus will say "I never knew you" thus in order to do God's will in order to enter the kingdom of heaven you must have Jesus know you. According to Paul this happens by inviting Jesus into your heart. With Jesus in your heart you will do the will of God
- 24: Put the word of Jesus into practice
  - wisdom: the house built upon the rock. It's steady among storms
  - foolish man: doesn't practice Jesus' teachings and is destroyed by storms easily
  - Jesus is the rock. Our foundation is in Jesus and God
    > his bow stayed steady... because of the mightly Ore of Jacob, because of the shepard, the **rock** of Israel, because of your father's God who helps you, because of the Almighty (Genesis 49:24)

    > my God is my rock (Psalm 18:2)
    
    > For they drank from the same spiritual rock... and that rock was Christ (1 Corintheans 10:4)

#### Matthew 8
- Matthew 8:4 
  - Jesus after healing the man
  > See that you don't tell anything (Matthew 8:4)
  - Did not want to stir up the popular
  - Don't go looking like a crazy person with just your words but instead "go show yourself to the priest... as a testimony to them"
  - The messiaanic secret
    - Jesus wanted to show by word and the deed the Messiah he was
    - Now we are the messangers, **listen first then show them Jesus** 
- 8:12 subjects of the kingdom of heaven = jews who thought their Judiasm was an inherited passport into the kingdom
  - But Jesus says they will be thrown outside into the darkness
- 8:17 carried our diseases = bore the burden of our diseases
  - Jesus is with us in our pain
- 8:21 first let me go and bury my father
  - his father is still alive otherwise the man would have already been preoccupied with his father's burial thus he was asking to follow Jesus after his father dies
  - Jesus answers that now is the time to follow Jesus
  - the spiritually dead could bury the physical dead but the spiritually alive should be busy proclaiming the kingdom of God
  - Jesus was responding to a teacher of the Law who valued children burying their parents. He's not commanding us to not bury our family
- 8:26 "You of little faith" in respond to "Lord, save us!" when the storm comes
  - seek first the kingdom of God and all things will be provided for you (6:30)
- 8:34 pleaded Jesus to leave because they were converned about the financial loss of the pigs over the saving of the demon-possessed man
  - don't prioritize money over people or Jesus
  - could also be because they were afraid of the power of Jesus which they couldn't comprehend
  - Jesus has power we don't understand. Will we accept it or reject it?

#### Matthew 9
- 9:2 When Jesus saw their faith as they had carried the man to have Jesus heal them
  - work and what you do is evidence of your faith
  - Same story as the man being lowered throught the roof in Mark 2:4
- 9:6 So that you might know Jesus has the authority to forgive sins he heals the man
  - Jesus didn't perform miracles to rid the Earth of evil but instead to prove to us that he can save us and bring us into heaven / eternal life
- 9:10 when Jesus has dinner with the tax collectors and "sinners"
  - 9:12 I desire mercy not sacrifice. For I have not come to call the righteous but sinners
    - righteous = don't realize their need for salvation
    - sinners = admitted sinners do realize their need of Jesus
    - Focus on what you can do and the people you can reach instead of those you can't
- 9:14 Jesus' disciples don't fast
  - being with Jesus is the time to Celebrate! Fasting is for times of sorrow (Jesus dying on the cross)
- 9:16 Putting an old patch on a new wine skin causes it to pull apart and ruins it
  - Don't pull away from Jesus
  - Don't mix the joy of Jesus (celebration) with the sorrow of loss (fasting)
  - Jesus transforms you into new wine, Jesus is not a patch
- 9:21 "If only I touch his cloak I will be healed"
- 9:22 "Take heart daughter", he said, "your faith has healed you"
  - "healed" in Greek actually means "saved"
  - Both physical "be freed from your suffering" (Mark 5:34) and spiritual salvation "Go in peace" (Mark 5:34)
- 9:24 "The girl is not dead butu asleep"
  - Not permanently dead
- "But they laughted at him"
  - Be prepared for people to doubt you and laugh at you while doing the will of God
- 9:25 "Took the girl by the hand and she got up"
  - "they were completely astonished" (Mark 5:42)
    - People were amazed by Jesus because of his authority. He used Godly power. He did not quote human authorities as other prophets did because Jesus' authority was directly from God
- 9:29 "According to your faith" Jesus healed the blind **not** in proportion to your faith
  - 17:20 parable of the mustard seed + moving the mountain
    - It's not so much the quantity of their faith but the quality of their faith
    - Move from here to here (the mountain)
      - Proverbial statement meaning to remove great difficulties
        - Psalm 54:10 "mountains be shaken... yet my unfailing love for you will not be shaken nor my convenant of peace be removed says the Lord who has compassion on you"
    - Removing problems associated with doing the work of the kingdom
    - Not actually moving mountains since this is in the context of the mustard seed
      - The mustard seed references 13:31 which was about growing the kingdom of God
 - Zechariah 4:7 Faith in the power of Go'ds spirit can overcome mountainous obsticles
   - figurative mountains = obsticles
 - Mark 9:23 "Everything is possible for him who believes"
   - Set no limit on what God can do
   - "help me overcome by unbelief"
     - Human belief is never perfect
     - Jesus points them to prayer. Their power comes from Jesus.
 - Mark 11:23 "says to the mountain 'Go throw yourself into the sea' and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what hesays will happen it will be done **for** him. Therefore whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have **received** it, and it will be yours"
   - You need to start taking action. Pray and God will give it to you. It may require action.
- 9:30 "See that no one knows about this"
  - 16:20 "not to tell anyone that he was the Christ"
  - Because of the false concepts of the Jews who looked for a political messiah who would destroy all other kingdoms and give the Jews all the political power, Jesus didn't want to cause a revolution against Rome
- 9:33 The man who had been mute spoke
  - Isiah 35:6 "the mute tongue shout for joy" when Isiah 35:4 "your God will come"
- 9:37 "The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest therefore to send out workers into his harvest field"
  - In response to Jesus "saw the crowds, he had compassion on them because they were harrassed and helpless like sheep without a shepard"
    - Ezekiel 34:8 "declares the Sovereign Lord.. because my shepard did not search for my flock but cared for themselves rather than for my flock... I will rescue my flock from their mouths and it will no longer be food for them"
      - Don't abuse others
    - Ezekiel 34:8 " I will tend them in good pasture"
      - Shepaards are faithless, God/Jesus become the good shepard
    - Ezekiel 34:20 "The Sovereign Lord says to them: See I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep"
  - We are the workers, God is the new good shepard. God saves, we are the messangers
  - Zechariah 10:2 people wander oppressed like sheep without a shepard because the shepards were abusing the people with false promises and false idols

#### Matthew 10
- 10:5 "Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans. Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel"
  - The good news was to be preclaimed first to the Jews
  - After Jesus' ressurection, Jesus commands the message to be taken to all nations
    - 28:19 "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations... and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always to the very end of the age"
    - 21:43 "the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit"
      - Taken from the Jews who rejected the gospel
- 10:16 "I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves"
  - Romans 16:19 "I want you to be wise about what is good and innocent about what is evil"
    - Focus on the good, avoid what is bad
  - shrewd = sharp ability in judgement
  - Be careful about evil and remain innocent 
- 10:19 "do not worry about what to say"
  - This is in the context of being arrested
  - "But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say"
    - Don't worry about defending yourself, you will be given what to say
  - Luke 21:14 "But make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves. For I wil give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries wil be able to resist or contradict
  - 10:20 "for it will not be you speaking but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you"
    - Pray!
- 10:22 "but he who stands firm to the end will be saved"
  - Hebrews 3:6 "But Christ is faithful as a son over God's house. And we are his house, if we hold on to our courage and the hope of which we boast"
    - Persevere in doing God's work. Doing God's will is how we are saved
      - Matthew 7:21 "Not everyone who says to me 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven"
  - Hebrews 6:10 "God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them"
- 10:23 "you will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes."
  - Could be that we won't be able to convert everyone before Jesus comes again. This could mean that it's possible for people to be saved after Jesus' second coming
    - 24:27 refers to the "coming of Son of Man" as the second coming
- 10:26-33 Refer to Luke 12:1-12 which gives more detail
  - Luke 12:1 "Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known"
    - Thus "will not be made known" is about hypocrisy (claiming to have moral standards which your own behavior doesn't conform to)
    - If you are a hypocrate, you will eventually get caught
  - Luke 12:5 "Fear him who after killing of the body, has the power to throw you into hell"
    - God alone has the power to throw you into hell
    - "hell" is actually "Geenna" in the original Greek which means place of the dead __not Hades__ 
      - "Geenna" derives it's name from a space where people perpetually were burning city dump. It was also a place where human sacrifices were offered to pagan Gods
    - "Fear him" means respect his authority, stand in awe of his majesty and trust in him. We can trust him because of Luke 12:6-7 "Yet not one of them is forgotten by God... Don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows"
  - Luke 12:9 "But he who disowns me before men will be disowned before the angels of God"
    - Disowned = "deny". The same word was used in Peter's denial when he denied knowing Christ three times. Yet Peter was forgiven. So maybe it's just a temporary disowning until you come back to Jesus?
  - Luke 12:10 "but anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven"
    - It seems that only Satan can blaspheme agains the Holy Spirit since otherwise these two sentences would conflict
      - Mark 3:28 "all the sins and blasphemies of men will be forgiven them. But whoever blasphemes against the Holy spirit will never be forgiven"
      - Matthew 12:31 "every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven."
        - Satan = the blasphemy against the Spirit
        - Men = forgiven
- Matthew 10:37 "Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me"
  - Is anyone worthy of Jesus? Jesus is a gift
  - Jesus is warning that conflict can even arise between members of the same family. And that you should choose believing in Jesus even if this causes family conflict.
- Matthew 10:38 see Luke 9:24 "For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it"
  - No other saying of Jesus is given such emphasis. Found in all four gospels and in two of the gospels multiple times
  - We will die on Earth, our attempts on saving our life on our own will fail. However if we give up our life to Jesus then Jesus will save us.
