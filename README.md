# Bible Notes

Discovering the word of God

## Belief Statement
- I believe in an all powerful, infinitely loving God. God loves you
  - Love is kind, forgiving, patient, humble and everlasting
- The two most important things God tells us is to:
  - Love God
  - Love others
- Thank God that God hasn't answered all my prayers. God knows better than I do
- The Bible is made up of God inspired writings by various humans
  - Just like how Jesus spoke in parrables/stories, the Bible is also made up of parrables/stories
    - This is because humans learn through stories not literal instructions. Computers learn through literal instructions. Since the Bible was written for humans we should interpret the stories of the Bible not always as literal instructions but more for the meaning and higher purpose of the stories
  - The Bible is **not** a verbatim narration of events
  - Humans were inspired to write about their encounters with the spirit of God, with the son of God (Jesus) and occasionally God the father
- Just because the Bible says `do X` doesn't mean `do X` applies in all situations or even in today's age. `do X` because the Bible says so would be called `taking something out of context`. The context of the Bible is a story of an all powerful, all loving God that wants us to love God and love each other. That should be the basis of everything we do no matter what `do X` we find in the Bible.
- Even if someone came with proof that Jesus never existed, I would still believe in Jesus. I would still believe that he has forgiven us, saved us and given us eternal life. This is because it's about the story that God is trying to tell us. God wants to convince you that the underlying message is true. Whether it happened verbatim or not doesn't really matter. What matters is that God loves you, God has saved you, God has forgiven you and God has given you an eternal life with him. Whatever methods he uses to make that true is good with me!

## Galatians 5:16 Spirit led. Enjoy life's pleasures!

> "Walk by the spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of ~~the flesh~~ _sinful nature_". (NIV)

- Flesh = Sarx (original greek) = Sinful nature
  - So this was a misinterpretation!
  - This is **not** telling you to abstain from wordly pleasures
- There is a war between the spirit and sinful nature. We need God's power to help us win that battle.


## Matthew 11:28 "Burned out on religion? Come to me."

> Are you tired? Worn out? Burned out on religion? Come to me. 
> Get away with me and you’ll recover your life. I’ll show you how to take a real rest. 
> Walk with me and work with me—watch how I do it. Learn the unforced rhythms of grace. 
> I won’t lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you. 
> Keep company with me and you’ll learn to live freely and lightly. (NIV)

- Jesus frees us from the law
  - Instead he gives us a spirit led life. One that does good because it is a joyful way to live
  - Following the law to the letter clearly didn't work. It lead to bitterness, pride and lack of love. That's why Jesus came to show us a new way
- Jesus frees us from guilt

## Luke 10:25 The Good Samaritan

> "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"... "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind"; and, "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Luke 10:25-27 NIV)

- Jesus isn't telling us to go around looking for people in ditches
  - Jesus didn't solve poverty, he didn't give money to all the beggars in the world
  - But he still loved them
    - Sometimes God will put it in your heart to help right now but sometimes God's plan is a different way
- Jesus is telling us what an eternal life looks like
1. Love God
2. Love one another
- If we do these things, we will enjoy a spirit filled life
  - Eternal = "noun: used to refer to an everlasting or universal spirit, as represented by God."

## Why did Jesus need to die and rise again?
- God is all powerful and could have saved us without sacrificing himself on the cross
- He did this as evidence to us so that we might believe that God can save us
- If God can die a torterous death, suffering deep pain, yet rise again three days later to do meraculous things, **then God can save you too** from your pain and use you to do meraculous things

## God is the same. God never changes
- **This is completely taken out of context**, the Bible does not actually say this as people lead you to believe
- God's love for you never changes
- God is a forever being. He never *changes* where `never changes = will never cease to exist`
- Thus we can always put our hope in God
- However God can still change, can still change his mind, can still change the world. God did not limit himself or his abilities. He can change.

## Hebrews 4:15 A God who empathizes with us
> For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, 
> but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin. (NIV)

- Jesus was tempted
- We shouldn't be ashamed of our temptations
- We shouldn't be driven by guilt
- Instead bring them to God and allow him to have control
- Be led by the spirit to do good instead of by guilt to not do bad


## Romans 12 Enjoy life!
> Embracing what God does for you is the best thing you can do for him

- There is so much gold in Romans 12. If you've lost purpose, take a moment and [read the message translation](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12&version=MSG)
- With God at the center, you get joy, love, peace, compassion even when life is tough, even when you're unhappy. You can find joy even in unhappiness.
  - We have to slowly reprogram ourselves to focus on this. It doesn't always come easy.

> The only accurate way to understand ourselves is by what God is and by what he does for us, not by what we are and what we do for him. (Romans 12:3 MSG)

> Love from the center of who you are; don’t fake it. (Romans 12:9 MSG)

> Don’t burn out (Romans 12:11 MSG)

> Don’t hit back; discover beauty in everyone... “I’ll do the judging,” says God. “I’ll take care of it.” (Romans 12:17-19 MSG)

>  Don’t let evil get the best of you; get the best of evil by doing good. (Romans 12:20-21 MSG)
