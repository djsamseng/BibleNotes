# Bible Notes

Discovering a more accurate interpretation of the word of God

## Galatians 5:16 Spirit led. Enjoy life's pleasures!

> "Walk by the spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of ~~the flesh~~ sinful nature"

- Flesh = Sarx (original greek) = Sinful nature
  - So this was a misinterpretation!
  - This is **not** telling you to abstain from wordly pleasures
- There is a war between the spirit and sinful nature. We need God's power to help us win that battle.


## Matthew 11:28 "Burned out on religion? Come to me."

> Are you tired? Worn out? Burned out on religion? Come to me. 
> Get away with me and you’ll recover your life. I’ll show you how to take a real rest. 
> Walk with me and work with me—watch how I do it. Learn the unforced rhythms of grace. 
> I won’t lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you. 
> Keep company with me and you’ll learn to live freely and lightly.

- Jesus frees us from the law
  - Instead he gives us a spirit led life. One that does good because it is a joyful way to live
  - Following the law to the letter clearly didn't work. It lead to bitterness, pride and lack of love. That's why Jesus came to show us a new way
- Jesus frees us from guilt


## Why did Jesus need to die and rise again?
- God is all powerful and could have saved us without sacrificing himself on the cross
- He did this as evidence to us so that we might believe that God can save us
- If God can die a torterous death, suffering deep pain, yet rise again three days later to do meraculous things, **then God can save you too** from your pain and use you to do meraculous things

## Hebrews 4:15 A God who empathizes with us
> For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, 
> but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin.

- Jesus was tempted
- We shouldn't be ashamed of our temptations
- We shouldn't be driven by guilt
- Instead bring them to God and allow him to have control
- Be led by the spirit to do good instead of by guilt to not do bad
