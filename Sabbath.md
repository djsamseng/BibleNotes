# Sabbath

## Summary
- We should rest in what God has done for us, and be good stewards of every moment, gift, and talent that God has given us.
  - Work and rest should be one and the same. We work from God's rest
- Jesus and the Holy Spirit delivers the new covanent. We are no longer under the covenant of the Ten Commandments.

## Details
- The command for a Sabbath day of rest was to keep God's people free from slavery.

>  “Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. 9 Six days you shall labor and do all your work, 10 but the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns. 11 For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy. (Exodus 20:8)

>  “Six days do your work, but on the seventh day do not work, so that your ox and your donkey may rest, and so that the slave born in your household and the foreigner living among you may be refreshed." (Exodus 23:12)

- Deuteronomy is Moses recollecting his teachings as he was about to pass away. He reinforces that the Sabbath is about freedom from slavery

>  “Observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy, as the Lord your God has commanded you. 13 Six days you shall labor and do all your work, 14 but the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your ox, your donkey or any of your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns, so that your male and female servants may rest, as you do. 15 Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the Lord your God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day." (Deuteronomy 5:12-16)

- We shouldn't enslave others and force them to work all the time.
- There is no command not to study, learn, or do good works.
  - In fact Jesus tells us to do good on the Sabbath
- **God made a new covenant with us through Jesus**
  - This wasn't the first time either. God made a covenant with Abraham in Genesis 9 and Genesis 17

> “The days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah. 32 It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt,
because they broke my covenant, though I was a husband to[d] them,[e]” declares the Lord. 33 “This is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel after that time,” declares the Lord.
“I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. 34 No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, ‘Know the Lord,’
because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest,” declares the Lord. “For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.” (Jeremiah 31:31-35)

- Thus we are no longer bound by the Law of Exodus (which we broke) but instead by the law that God puts on our hearts and minds through Jesus and the Holy Spirit

> "It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat." 11 But he replied, "The man who made me well said to me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.' " (John 5:10-11)

- because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jewish leaders began to persecute him.

> 17 In his defense Jesus said to them, "My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I too am working." (John 5:17)

- Thus we can work for God every day
  - We should never treat anyone as slaves (the original purpose of the commandment)

> “How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.” (Matthew‬ ‭12‬:‭12‬)

> “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. 28 So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.” (‭‭Mark 2‬:‭27-28‬ ‭NIV‬‬)

- Don't work for selfish gain but instead to be a good steward of what God has gifted us.
  - The original word for work in the Ten Commandments meant working for selfish gain
  - Instead we should rest in Jesus (the fulfillment of Sabbath rest) and do good works for God
  - We should do this every day
  - This is why the seventh day of rest in the creation story never ended
