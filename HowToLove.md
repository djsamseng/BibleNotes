# How to Love

- It starts with God. There is no greater love than God
  - First position ourselves in God's love. He fills us with provision, purpose, with plans, with all that we need.
  - Out of this there is an overflow that we love others
  - We don't try to do this loving thing outside of God. We ask God to teach us to love him, teach us to receive what God has given us and he will help us love others
  - It is not by power, it is not by might but by the spirit of God
- Love others as we love ourselves
  - We want to fill our hunger, shelter over our head, clothes on our back, have a purpose, fulfillment, joy, community, sense of belonging
    - Jesus assumes this, he knows its innate in us
  - Just as we have this innate in us, have this also for others
  - Just as we are self seeking to see ourselves fulfilled, want this for others, see their life go forward

## Vision
### People to People
- Volunteering at NYP hosting activities on weekends to help ease the boredom of the weekends
- Engaging and interactive presentations that spark the creativity and inspiration of high school and college students
- **Anonymously** Feed the hungry, cure the sick, shelter the homeless.
   - **Anonymously** Giving people a second chance. Cloth them, feed them, bathe them and help them regain their strength. It could be a homeless person, a vet, a burned out collegue, someone who lost their job or their family
   - Be careful [Family takes in homeless and is murdered](https://qr.ae/pvW4VE)
- Jesus was wise in saying that he came to save those who are humble and not the proud. He teaches us to move on (wipe our feet and brush off the dirty) from those who don't hear our message and pursue those who want to change
  - Be careful [https://qr.ae/pvqMex](https://qr.ae/pvqMex) to help and love people not enable destructive behavior
